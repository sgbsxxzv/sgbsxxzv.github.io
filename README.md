Hi to my favorite person :>

I just want to say na thank you for staying with me kahit na we always fight. Thank you for appreciating me and for always complimenting me. I really like you and uhm I'm not really good at expressing things like it's hard for me to like express my care for that person but I'll always try and always make you feel that you're loved. I hope na we always stay like this and grow together, hehehe shs life is coming and we're going to separate ways na sana wag ka makahanap ng mas pogi dyan sa main hahahahah joke, kidding aside, I want you to know that I'm always here for you and I'll always support your choices and celebrate your future endeavors. You always make me smile when you create small and cute gestures, specially pag nahihiya ka hehe. At first, I thought na this will not turn out good like we're just going to be flings, but suddenly everything reminds me of you, everything is about you, and yun na fall haahahah. Always remember that I will never get tired of u poo, I'll always rest with you. Be happy always and take care of yourself :>

HAPPY VALENTINES, TOM! :>

ILY<3
